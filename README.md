# The-Gaming-Room

The Gaming Room is a client that wanted to develop a web-based game that would serve on multiple platforms that is based on their current game "Draw It or Lose It."
The one thing that I did really well with this software design template was to understand the clients requirements and display those requirements in the executive 
summary and identify the design constraints. It is important to understand the clients needs and requirements, not only because its what is required, but it also helps
in the design of the program as well. With the clients needs in mind we can design a program that is best suited for them and find ways to combat any problems that may arise.
In this project I understood the ideas very well, we needed to design a program that would work across multiple platforms, therefore design a UI that could be visually
recognizable, but also work well on whichever platform used. Also, have the ability to have unique player and team names. A singleton design pattern was best suited for 
this requirement. Looking back on the template, one section that can be improved on would be making recommendations. I am fairly new to the programming world so 
I may not have the best recommendations, since I lack experience. However, I'm familiar with how programs should opperate and which designs can work for my clients needs.
